# Visual-Graphics-Editor
For this Graphics Editor, I have used C &amp; C++ programming languages to provide features like drawing and scaling rectangle, line, ellipse, and provided support for certain repertoire of image editing options

For creating the GUI and implementing various functionalities, gaphics.h header fileâ€™s functions are used with the mouse interrupt functions.
